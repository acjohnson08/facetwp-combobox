# FacetWP - Combobox
This WordPress plugin introduces a new combobox facet type for FacetWP which renders facets as Semantic UI dropdowns. Both single search selection and multiple search selection is supported for this facet type.

**Note**
> Semantic UI utilizes it's own styles, some of which are required for components to function properly. You may need to add additional CSS to your WordPress theme to fully integrate this facet type based on your unique needs.

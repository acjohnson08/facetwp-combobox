# FacetWP - Combobox

This WordPress plugin introduces a new combobox facet type for [FacetWP](https://facetwp.com) that renders facets as [Semantic UI dropdowns](https://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html). It supports both single and multiple search selections for this facet type.

## Features
- Supports both single search and multiple search selections
